> What is Melotte

Melotte is a dweb context, a framework and a platform, using Orbit-db and IPFS.

> What's the difference

- Offline-first and censorship-resistant
  - It configures and runs go-ipfs instances
- Auto-downloading and pinning
  - It is not light nodes, for better decentralization.
- Permission management based on hashchains
- WASM-running daemon for the hashchains and site backends
