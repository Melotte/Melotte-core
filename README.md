> What is Melotte

Melotte is a dweb context, a framework and a platform, based on IPFS.

- It's similar to Heroku
  - Sites are automatically deployed
- It's user-driven, which most benefits users too

> What's the difference

- Offline-first and censorship-resistant
  - It configures and runs go-ipfs instances
- Auto-downloading and pinning
  - It is not light nodes, for better decentralization.
- Permission management based on hashchains
  - Less reliance on the centralized web. More democracy
- WASM-running daemon for the hashchains and site backends
  - Dweb service independent of browsers
- Database and indices configured and synchronized with IPLD
  - [EJDB](https://github.com/Softmotions/ejdb)

> What Melotte is Not

- NOT a blockchain, or its derivative
